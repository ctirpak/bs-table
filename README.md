# bs-table
bootstrap table with jquery

bs-table is a jQuery plugin that turns an ordinary HTML table into a Bootstrap-styled table. This plugin also adds additional features such as sorting and searching, and the ability to interact with the data by clicking on a row. This provides a mechanism that can be used to add additional functional, such as a drill down capability.
